    <p class="message">
<b>HALLOO</b>, I JUST WANNA WISH YOU A HEARTFELT HAPPYUI BIRTHDAYYY. It's a shame that time moves so fast, because it just feels like yesterday since we became friends lol. (throwback to 2018 cuz I remember first meeting you at you guy's house) and I am so GLAD that we got to be friends.
    You're such a wonderful person who genuinely cares and puts effort towards everything and everyone (even if you don't know them). And every time we talk, the energy you dispose is just SO UPLIFTING I CANT EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS BROROJHIFHOWIH
- Just know that you've got a heart of silver :&gt;  

      Hope you have a wonderful and blessed year ahead and enjoy your birthday (GIB PIZZA)
